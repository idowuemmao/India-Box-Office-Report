### **Project Description: Data-Driven Analysis of Hospital Patient Care**  

#### **Project Overview**  
This project, **"Improving Patient Care Through Data-Driven Solutions,"** aims to analyze key factors influencing patient care quality in hospitals. Using a dataset of 10,000 patients, the study explores patterns in patient demographics, diagnoses, length of stay, discharge destinations, medication adherence, and care satisfaction. The goal is to uncover insights that help healthcare providers enhance patient outcomes, improve hospital efficiency, and optimize care delivery.

#### **Project Objectives**  
- Identify trends in patient demographics, including age, gender, and diagnosis types.  
- Analyze the impact of **length of stay (LOS)** on patient satisfaction and hospital resource utilization.  
- Evaluate the relationship between **medication adherence** and care satisfaction.  
- Determine the most effective **discharge destinations** for improved recovery outcomes.  
- Assess the correlation between **comorbidities** and hospital stay duration.  
- Provide actionable **recommendations** to improve patient care strategies.

#### **Methodology & Tools**  
- **Data Processing**: Clean and transform data using **Google Sheets Power Query** for structured analysis.  
- **Visualizations**: Create **pivot tables, slicers, KPI cards, and scatter plots** to illustrate trends.  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Use **correlation analysis** to assess relationships between care satisfaction, length of stay, and discharge destinations.  
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Generate data-driven recommendations to enhance hospital efficiency and patient outcomes.

#### **Key Insights**  
- **Patient Demographics:** Elderly patients (65+) form the largest group, while teens (12-18) are the least hospitalized.  
- **Diagnosis Patterns:** Injuries and respiratory problems are the most common primary diagnoses.  
- **Care Satisfaction & Length of Stay:** Patients with a **22-28 day stay** reported the highest satisfaction, while shorter stays (8-14 days) had lower ratings.  
- **Discharge Outcomes:** Patients discharged to **rehabilitation centers** reported slightly higher satisfaction than those sent home or to nursing facilities.  
- **Medication Adherence:** Surprisingly, patients who did **not** adhere to medications reported higher satisfaction scores than those who did.

#### **Recommendations**  
1. **Improve Short-Term Care**: Enhance treatment plans for patients with shorter hospital stays to improve satisfaction.  
2. **Optimize Discharge Planning**: Strengthen rehabilitation programs for elderly patients to ensure smooth transitions post-hospitalization.  
3. **Encourage Medication Adherence**: Implement better patient education and follow-up systems to improve adherence without impacting satisfaction.  
4. **Enhance Care for High-Risk Diagnoses**: Provide targeted interventions for patients with respiratory problems, as they report the lowest satisfaction and longest hospital stays.  
5. **Personalized Care Plans**: Develop specialized care strategies for different patient age groups to ensure optimal treatment and satisfaction.

#### **Conclusion**  
This project highlights critical factors affecting patient care and provides **data-backed solutions** to enhance healthcare service quality. By leveraging insights from this analysis, hospitals can **refine their patient management strategies, improve satisfaction scores, and optimize resource allocation**, leading to better healthcare outcomes.
